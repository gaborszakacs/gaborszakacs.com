If you go cold turkey with your previous editor and start using Vim all-in, you
will jump out from it quicker than a frog from hot boiling water. At least
that's what I did. But there's another way. You can keep your productivity and
make a gradual transition towards using Vim full-time. You can put the frog in
tepid water and boil it slowly.

Vim is notorious for its steep learning curve. Add the dogma laid down by the
hardcore Vim evangelists, "you art not true Vimmer if you don't use pure Vim"
and the ones similar to "one shan't use the arrow keys", and you find yourself
in a difficult situation. You either practice during nights and weekends, then a year later you come out of the closet and ask for admission from the council of olds or - more probably - you just don't bother.

I suggest you take a more pragmatical approach. If you think Vim would make you a more productive developer (and it would), don't care about what others have to say and create a plan how will you make the transition. You might use this list as a starting point.

- 1\. Get motivated
- 2\. Learn how to touch type
- 3\. Finish Vimtutor
- 4\. Enable Vim mode in your current editor
- 5\. Practice with katas
- 6\. Go live: use Vim mode in production
- 7\. Find a long weekend and build your IDE in Vim
- 8\. Practice with katas
- 9\. Go live: use Vim in production
- 10\. Keep learning
- +1 Max out your setup by mastering Tmux

Let's take a look at each in more detail.

## 1. Get motivated

You have a long road ahead of you. You will feel unproductive, you will be frustrated, you won't be able to do basic stuff that you learnt to do in your editor as a freshman. Work on your motivation so it can get you through the hard times.

I don't want to convince you that Vim is superior to your current editor. This post is not about that. I suppose you're already convinced. But I urge you to reflect on your thoughts and harden that motivation. These worked for me:

- Watch someone using Vim in your programming language and being awesome. Watch code being written by sorcery. It's best if you have such a collegue and you try to pair-program with them, but YouTube works too. I code a lot in Ruby, so watcing [Ben Orenstein's refactoring speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC-pQPq0acs) was quite a mind-blowing experience.

- Call back the memory of having learnt how to touch type. For me learning Vim was very similar to this. You free your mind from uninteresting clutter. You don't have to think about how to press individual buttons anymore, you're fingers are just typing what you want to say. Same goes with Vim. You don't have to push arrow keys or use the mouse to get to the section you want to edit and then do the same to highlight a text you want to modify, you just say it in your head and you're fingers do the work. (Go to "foo", change these code until the closing parenthesis to "bar baz". Do the same three times.) You can concentrate on the stuff that actually needs thinking, like what to write, not how to write it.

- Fantasize about the setup you could have if you only used a terminal to do your work. I usually have to modify or at least look into 3-4 different repositories a day. I used to have different spaces (desktops) for each, having the terminal and the editor nicely arranged in each. I had to keep in mind which workspace is where, how many times I had to swipe right to get to the space I wanted. Having converted this to Tmux sessions was a real game-changer. Switching to vim made this setup available. Watch videos [how can Tmux help you organize your workspaces](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/tmux)
